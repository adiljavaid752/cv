        I am a professor at Cornell University. My research focuses on
        algorithms and networks, the roles they play in large-scale social and
        information systems, and their broader societal implications. My work
        has been supported by an NSF Career Award, an ONR Young Investigator
        Award, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, a Packard Foundation
        Fellowship, a Simons Investigator Award, a Sloan Foundation Fellowship,
        a Vannevar Bush Faculty Fellowship, and grants from Facebook, Google,
        Yahoo, the MacArthur Foundation, the ARO, and the NSF. I am a member of
        the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering,
        and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Link to: Contact

        In Spring 2022, Karen Levy and I are teaching Choices and Consequences
        in Computing (INFO 1260 / CS 1340). The course is designed at an
        introductory level with no formal prerequisites, and covers a range of
        ethical, societal, and policy implications of computing and information.

        D. Easley, J. Kleinberg. Networks, Crowds, and Markets: Reasoning About
        a Highly Connected World. Cambridge University Press, 2010. This book is
        based on an inter-disciplinary course that we teach entitled Networks.
        The book, like the course, is designed at the introductory undergraduate
        level with no formal prerequisites. To support deeper explorations, most
        of the chapters are supplemented with optional advanced sections

        J. Kleinberg, E. Tardos. Algorithm Design. Addison Wesley, 2005. This
        book is based on the undergraduate algorithms course that we both teach.
        We also use the more advanced parts for our graduate algorithms course.>
